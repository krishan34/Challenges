// Challenge 1
/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
and height in meter).
Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
m tall.
§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
m tall 

Your tasks:


// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
const markMass = 95;
const markHeight = 1.88;
const johnMass = 85;
const johnHeight = 1.76;
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;

console.log(markBMI, johnBMI);

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;

if (markHigherBMI) {
  console.log("Mark has a higher BMI than john");
} else {
  console.log("John has a higher BMI than Mark");
}

// coding challenge 2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Hint: Use an if/else statement �

Your tasks:

// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
  console.log("Mark has a higher BMI than john");
} else {
  console.log("John has a higher BMI than Mark");
}

// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI ${markBMI} is higher than john's ${johnBMI}`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI ${johnBMI} is higher than Mark ${markBMI}`);
}

// Coding Challenge #3

// Test data:
//  § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below

const dolphinsAvg = (97 + 112 + 81) / 3;
const KoalasAvg = (109 + 95 + 88) / 3;

console.log(dolphinsAvg, KoalasAvg);

// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score)

if (dolphinsAvg > KoalasAvg) {
  console.log("dolphin Win");
} else if (dolphinsAvg === KoalasAvg) {
  console.log("both team evenly matched");
} else {
  console.log("koals Win");
}

// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks

const dolphinScore = dolphinsAvg;
const KoalasScore = KoalasAvg;

if (dolphinScore >= 100 && KoalasScore >= 100) {
  if (dolphinsAvg > KoalasAvg) {

  } else {
    console.log("koals Win");
  }
} else {
  console.log("both team score below 100");
}

// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

if (dolphinScore >= 100 && KoalasScore >= 100) {
  if (dolphinsAvg > KoalasAvg) {

JavaScript Fundamentals – Part 2
Coding Challenge #1

Apply this to the team's average scores �

Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team). A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:

Test data:
§ Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
§ Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
Hints:
§ To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3 § To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B. 

// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores

const calcAverage = (a, b, c) => (a + b + c) / 3;
// 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams

const dolphinsAvg = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
const koalasAvg = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);
console.log(dolphinsAvg, koalasAvg);

// 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"

const checkWinner = function (dolphinScore, koalasScore) {
  if (dolphinScore >= 2 * koalasScore) {
    console.log(`Dolphin Win(${dolphinsAvg} vs ${koalasAvg})`);
  } else if (koalasScore >= 2 * dolphinScore) {
    console.log(`Kolas Win(${dolphinsAvg} vs ${koalasAvg})`);
  } else { 
    console.log(`No one Wins`);
  }
};

// 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and Data 2

checkWinner(dolphinsAvg, koalasAvg);

// 5. Ignore draws this time


// Coding Challenge #2

// Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// Test data: 125, 555 and 44
// Hint: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new

// Your tasks:
// 1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100

function calcTip(bill) {
  return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;

// 1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values

const bills = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];

// 2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')

// 4. Bonus: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to

// solve it:

// 4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together

// 4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)

// 4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array GOOD LUCK �

Coding Challenge #1
We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends �)!
Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on 
next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
Your tasks:
1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 
'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field 
players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the 
goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 
field players
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 
players)
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a 
new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 
'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 
'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player 
names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the 
number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which 
team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary 
operator.
Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. 
Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from 
before.
Your tasks:
1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, 
along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already 
studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them 
(except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the 
same property names �
4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the 
players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this 
game, it will look like this:

'gameEvents' (see below) with a log of the events that happened during the 
game. The values are the events themselves, and the keys are the minutes in which 
each event happened (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time).
Your tasks:
1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no 
duplicates)
2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64 
was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on 
average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking 
whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:

A Closer Look at Functions
Coding Challenge #1
Let's build a simple poll app!
A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an 
array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter 
'poll' object below.
Your tasks:
1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The 
method does 2 things:
1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the 
selected option. The prompt should look like this:
What is your favourite programming language?
0: JavaScript
1: Python
2: Rust
3: C++
(Write option number)
1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For 
example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by 
1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes 
sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The 
method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string'
or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using 
console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a 
string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 
'registerNewAnswer' method call.
5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test 
data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll 
object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation?

Working With Arrays
Coding Challenge #1
Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners 
about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For 
now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years 
old.
Your tasks:
Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages 
('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have 
cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat 
ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function 
parameters)
2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 
is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy 
� ")
4. Run the function for both test datasets
Test data:
§ Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]

Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert 
dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
Your tasks:
Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's 
ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is 
<= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, 
humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as 
keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know 
from other challenges how we calculate averages �)
4. Run the function for both test datasets

Coding Challenge #4
Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are 
eating too much or too little.
Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the 
recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10% 
above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).
Your tasks:
1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate 
the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do 
not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla: 
recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of 
food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too 
little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in 
the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) �
3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much 
('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little 
('ownersEatTooLittle').
4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and 
Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat 
too little!"
5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food 
that is recommended (just true or false)
6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food 
(just true or false)
7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try 
to reuse the condition used in 6.)
8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food 
portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the 
array's objects �)

Hints:
§ Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary 
lecture to choose between them � § Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means: 
current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 
1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the 
recommended portion.
Test data:
 const dogs = [
 { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ['Alice', 'Bob'] },
 { weight: 8, curFood: 200, owners: ['Matilda'] },
 { weight: 13, curFood: 275, owners: ['Sarah', 'John'] },
 { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners: ['Michael'] },
 ];

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
Coding Challenge #1
Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a 
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in 
km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, 
and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log 
the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 
'brake' multiple times on each of them
Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
§ Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

Coding Challenge #2
Your tasks:
1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide 
by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but 
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
GOOD LUCK �
Coding Challenge #3
Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child
"class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the 
current battery charge in % ('charge' property)
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 
'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, 
and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 
km/h, with a charge of 22%'
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 
'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when 
you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism �
Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

Coding Challenge #4
Your tasks:
1. Re-create Challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl'
child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery'
methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl'
class. Then experiment with chaining!
Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

Asynchronous JavaScript
Coding Challenge #1
In this challenge you will build a function 'whereAmI' which renders a country 
only based on GPS coordinates. For that, you will use a second API to geocode 
coordinates. So in this challenge, you’ll use an API on your own for the first time �
Your tasks:
PART 1
1. Create a function 'whereAmI' which takes as inputs a latitude value ('lat') 
and a longitude value ('lng') (these are GPS coordinates, examples are in test 
data below).
2. Do “reverse geocoding” of the provided coordinates. Reverse geocoding means 
to convert coordinates to a meaningful location, like a city and country name. 
Use this API to do reverse geocoding: https://geocode.xyz/api. The AJAX call 
will be done to a URL with this format: 
https://geocode.xyz/52.508,13.381?geoit=json. Use the fetch API and 
promises to get the data. Do not use the 'getJSON' function we created, that 
is cheating �
3. Once you have the data, take a look at it in the console to see all the attributes 
that you received about the provided location. Then, using this data, log a 
message like this to the console: “You are in Berlin, Germany”
4. Chain a .catch method to the end of the promise chain and log errors to the 
console
5. This API allows you to make only 3 requests per second. If you reload fast, you 
will get this error with code 403. This is an error with the request. Remember, 
fetch() does not reject the promise in this case. So create an error to reject 
the promise yourself, with a meaningful error message
PART 2
6. Now it's time to use the received data to render a country. So take the relevant 
attribute from the geocoding API result, and plug it into the countries API that 
we have been using.
7. Render the country and catch any errors, just like we have done in the last 
lecture (you can even copy this code, no need to type the same code)

Coding Challenge #2 For this challenge you will actually have to watch the video! Then, build the image 
loading functionality that I just showed you on the screen.
Your tasks:
Tasks are not super-descriptive this time, so that you can figure out some stuff by 
yourself. Pretend you're working on your own �
PART 1
1. Create a function 'createImage' which receives 'imgPath' as an input. 
This function returns a promise which creates a new image (use 
document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the 
provided image path
2. When the image is done loading, append it to the DOM element with the 
'images' class, and resolve the promise. The fulfilled value should be the 
image element itself. In case there is an error loading the image (listen for 
the'error' event), reject the promise
3. If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the solution
PART 2
4. Consume the promise using .then and also add an error handler
5. After the image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds using the 'wait'
function we created earlier
6. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image (set display CSS 
property to 'none'), and load a second image (Hint: Use the image element 
returned by the 'createImage' promise to hide the current image. You will 
need a global variable for that �)
7. After the second image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds again
8. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image
Test data: Images in the img folder. Test the error handler by passing a wrong 
image path. Set the network speed to “Fast 3G” in the dev tools Network tab, 
otherwise images load too fast

Coding Challenge #3
Your tasks:
PART 1
1. Write an async function 'loadNPause' that recreates Challenge #2, this time 
using async/await (only the part where the promise is consumed, reuse the 
'createImage' function from before)
2. Compare the two versions, think about the big differences, and see which one 
you like more
3. Don't forget to test the error handler, and to set the network speed to “Fast 3G”
in the dev tools Network tab
PART 2
1. Create an async function 'loadAll' that receives an array of image paths 
'imgArr'
2. Use .map to loop over the array, to load all the images with the 
'createImage' function (call the resulting array 'imgs')
3. Check out the 'imgs' array in the console! Is it like you expected?
4. Use a promise combinator function to actually get the images from the array �
5. Add the 'parallel' class to all the images (it has some CSS styles)
Test data Part 2: ['img/img-1.jpg', 'img/img-2.jpg', 'img/img-
3.jpg']. To test, turn off the 'loadNPause' function
GOOD LUCK
